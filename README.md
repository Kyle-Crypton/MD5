# MD5


## Introduction
The MD5 message-digest algorithm is a widely used vulnerable cryptographic hash function producing a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value, typically expressed in text format as a 32-digit hexadecimal number. MD5 has been utilized in a wide variety of cryptographic applications and is also commonly used to verify data integrity.

MD5 is a one-way function; it is neither encryption nor encoding. It can be reversed by brute-force attack and suffers from extensive vulnerabilities as detailed in the security section below.

## Examples

```
$./md5 "Kr4t0n"
f97508487374487c59ca3bb785db86a6
```

## Usage
To compile the file, type the command "g++ -o MD5 main.cpp".

## Functions
The program provides a MD5 algorithm to encrypt the string you type.
