# MD5


##Introduction
***
The MD5 message-digest algorithm is a widely used vulnerable cryptographic hash function producing a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value, typically expressed in text format as a 32-digit hexadecimal number. MD5 has been utilized in a wide variety of cryptographic applications and is also commonly used to verify data integrity.

MD5 is a one-way function; it is neither encryption nor encoding. It can be reversed by brute-force attack and suffers from extensive vulnerabilities as detailed in the security section below.

##Examples
***

```
$./md5 "Kyle-Crypton"
d124d344bd112747df03ebc95842d0c5
```

##Usage
***
To compile the file, type the command "g++ -o MD5 main.cpp".

##Functions
***
The program provides a MD5 algorithm to encrypt the string you type.
